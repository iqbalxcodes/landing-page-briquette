        <div>Premium Quality Grades of Coconut Charcoal Briquettes Indonesia</div>
        <div>
            <p>At PT CMM, we categorize our supply into two specialized tiers to meet global market demands. Specifically, we offer Platinum Boutique and Gold Commercial grades. For premium lounge requirements, our Boutique grade provides an industry-leading burning time of up to 140 minutes. In addition, it features an ultra-low ash content between 1.9% and 2.2%.</p>
            <p>Both grades are engineered for excellence. Furthermore, we maintain a high fixed carbon level of up to 82% and low moisture below 6%. This ensures a smokeless, odorless, and consistent heat for every user. Therefore, our briquettes guarantee a superior hookah experience with minimal volatile matter.
            </p>
            <p>We oversee a rigorous quality verification process for every shipment. Consequently, we ensure consistent high fixed carbon levels and ultra-low ash content in every batch. We understand that purity is paramount for the Shisha and Hookah industry. Because of this, our products are 100% chemical-free. They provide an odorless experience with a natural white ash finish that protects your tobacco flavors.
